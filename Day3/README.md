## Info - Terraform Providers
<pre>
- Terraform depends on Providers to provision resources
- For example
  - In order to provision an ec2 instance in AWS, Terraform depends on a provider called AWS ( registry.terraform.io )
  - IN order to provision an azure VM in Azure portal, Terraform depends on a provider called Azure
  - as long as there is a provider, Terraform can provision resources on that environment
  - In case, to provision a particular type of resource within your organization and there is no read-made provider, you can
    develop your own provider in Golang using Terraform Provider SDK
  - Providers supports two types of objects/resources
    1. Resources
       - If you wish to Provision ec2 instances using Terraform, then you will define a resource block expressing your expected state
       - Terrafrom can Create, Replace, Update and Delete the resources managed by Terraform
    2. DataSources ( already existing resources - these objects will be treated by Terraform as a read-only resource )
       - these resources are not managed by Terraform
       - they are managed outside Terraform
       - Terraform can refer and use it the HCL (Hashicorp Configuration Language - Terraform's proprietary language )
       - IN case to provision certain resource you declarative terraform script(manifest) file depends on already existing resource
         then, we call them as DataSources or Data block
